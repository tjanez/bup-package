%description
Very efficient backup system based on the git packfile format, providing fast
incremental saves and global deduplication (among and within files, including
virtual machine images). Some of its features are:
* It uses a rolling checksum algorithm and hence it can backup huge files
  incrementally.
* It uses packfile format from git, so one can access the stored data even if
  he doesn't like bup's user interface.
* It writes packfiles directly so it is fast even with huge amounts of data:
  it can track millions of files and keep track of hundreds or thousands of
  gigabytes of objects.
* Data is "automagically" shared between incremental backups without having to
  know which backup is based on which other one.
* One can make a backup directly to a remote bup server, without needing tons
  of temporary disk space on the computer being backed up. If the backup is
  interrupted halfway through, the next run will pick up where the previous
  backup left off.
* It can use "par2" redundancy to recover corrupted backups even if the disk
  has undetected bad sectors.
* Each incremental backup acts as if it's a full backup, it just takes less
  disk space.
* One can mount a bup repository as a FUSE filesystem and access the contents
  that way, or even export it over Samba.
